# Understanding Time Complexity and Space Complexity

## What is Time Complexity?
- It describes how the execution time of an algorithm grows as the input size increases.
- It is usually measured in terms of the number of operations performed by the algorithm.

## Asymptotic Notation
- It is used to describe the growth rate of an algorithm's time or space complexity.
- Types:
  - Big O notation: O(f(n)) (worst-case)
  - Big Omega notation: Ω(f(n)) (best-case)
  - Big Theta notation: Θ(f(n)) (average-case)

## What is Space Complexity?
- It describes how the memory usage of an algorithm grows as the input size increases.
